# Online Multiplayer Fixes - Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… Host Disconnecting Immediately
**Problem:** Network manager was disconnecting every time state changed  
**Solution:** Added `useRef` to track handler setup and prevent re-running

### 2. âœ… Connection Closing When Game Starts
**Problem:** Lobby component disconnected network when transitioning to game  
**Solution:** Added `isTransitioningToGame` ref to skip disconnect during game start

### 3. âœ… Clients Not Seeing All Players
**Problem:** Clients only saw themselves, not existing players in lobby  
**Solution:** Added `player-list` message that host sends to new joiners with full player list

### 4. âœ… Canvas Not Full Screen on Client
**Problem:** Canvas wasn't properly sized on non-host browsers  
**Solution:** 
- Added window resize handler
- Updated canvas className to use fixed positioning with full width/height
- Added `touchAction: 'none'` to prevent mobile scrolling

### 5. âœ… No Restart in Online Mode
**Problem:** "Play Again" button only showed for local mode  
**Solution:** Show button for all modes, but behavior differs:
- **Local mode:** Restarts game immediately
- **Online mode:** Goes back to lobby

### 6. âœ… Restart Not Checking Ready State
**Problem:** Host clicking "Play Again" started game immediately without checking if players are ready  
**Solution:** Changed to "Back to Lobby" flow:
- Host and clients return to lobby
- All ready states reset to false
- Players must click ready again
- Host can start when all are ready

## How It Works Now

### Game Flow - Online Multiplayer

1. **Create/Join Room**
   - Host creates room, gets room code
   - Clients join with room code
   - All players appear in lobby

2. **Getting Ready**
   - Each player clicks "Ready"
   - Host sees all ready states
   - Host can only start when all players ready

3. **Playing**
   - Game runs with synchronized state
   - Host sends state updates to clients
   - Clients send input to host

4. **Game Ends**
   - Winner announced on all screens
   - Two buttons appear:
     - **"Back to Lobby"** (Enter) - Return to lobby
     - **"Main Menu"** (Esc) - Disconnect and go to main menu

5. **Back to Lobby**
   - All players return to lobby
   - Ready states reset to false
   - Players can ready up again
   - Host starts next game when all ready

## Network Messages Added

- Sent from host to new joiner
- Contains full list of all players in room
- Ensures clients see everyone

### `back-to-lobby`
- Sent from host to all clients
- Triggers return to lobby
- Resets ready states

### `restart-game` (deprecated)
